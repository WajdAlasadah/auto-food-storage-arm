ü§ñ Automated Food Warehouse Robot
This project presents a smart robotic system designed to fully automate the storage and handling of food items in a warehouse without any human intervention. The solution involves a 6-DOF robotic arm, sensors, a conveyor belt, and smart shelving.

üìå Project Description
The system automates the food storage process by:

Receiving items through a conveyor

Using a vision camera to recognize the type of food

Measuring the weight using sensors

Moving the item to the appropriate location via a robotic arm

Automatically updating the storage database

The goal is to improve speed, accuracy, and safety in warehouse operations.

üß† Execution Algorithm
Start the system

Check warehouse readiness (power, sensors, etc.)

Receive food items through the conveyor belt

Use the vision camera to identify item type

Measure the item‚Äôs weight using a weight sensor

Determine the best storage location

Move the robotic arm to pick and place the item

Update the storage database with item info and location

Return the system to standby

Repeat for each new item or shut down when finished
